# Dynamic Programming Problems and Solutions

This directory contains algorithm problems that use dynamic programming approaches.

## Approach

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable when:

1. **Optimal Substructure**: The optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to subproblems
2. **Overlapping Subproblems**: The problem can be broken down into subproblems which are reused multiple times

Common DP patterns include:

- **Top-down (Memoization)**: Recursively solve problems and cache results to avoid redundant calculations
- **Bottom-up (Tabulation)**: Iteratively build up solutions to subproblems and use them to solve larger problems

## Problems

- **Longest Palindromic Substring**: Find the longest substring that is a palindrome
- **Longest Common Subsequence**: Find the longest subsequence common to two sequences
- **Coin Change**: Find the fewest number of coins to make up a given amount

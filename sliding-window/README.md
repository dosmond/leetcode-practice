# Sliding Window Problems and Solutions

This directory contains algorithm problems that use the sliding window technique.

## Approach

The sliding window technique involves maintaining a subarray or "window" of elements and sliding it through the array to find the optimal solution. This approach is efficient for:

1. **Subarrays with a constraint**: Finding subarrays that satisfy certain conditions
2. **Maximum/minimum subarray**: Finding the maximum or minimum sum/product subarray
3. **String problems**: Finding substrings with certain properties

## Problems

- **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**: Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters
- **Minimum Size Subarray Sum**: Find the minimum length subarray with sum greater than or equal to a target value

# LeetCode Practice

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems, organized by algorithmic approach.

## Organization

The problems are organized into directories based on the primary algorithm or technique used to solve them:

- **Arrays**: Problems involving array manipulation
- **Backtracking**: Problems solved using backtracking techniques
- **Dynamic Programming**: Problems solved using dynamic programming
- **Math**: Problems involving mathematical concepts
- **Sliding Window**: Problems solved using the sliding window technique
- **String**: Problems focusing on string manipulation
- **Tree**: Problems involving tree data structures
- **Two Pointers**: Problems solved using the two pointers technique

## Running the Solutions

Most solutions are written in JavaScript and can be run using Node.js:

```bash
node [directory]/[problem]/[filename].js
```

## Adding New Problems

When adding new problems, place them in the appropriate algorithm directory based on the approach used to solve them.

## Repository Structure

- Each problem is contained in its own directory with its solution file
- Problems are organized by different problem-solving techniques (e.g., sliding window, two-pointer, etc.)

## Configuration Files

- `.cursorrules`: Contains configuration settings for the Cursor IDE, helping to maintain consistent coding standards and practices while working on solutions
- `.windsurfrules`: Contains additional IDE configuration settings for enhanced development experience

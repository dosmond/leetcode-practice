# Tree Problems and Solutions

This directory contains tree-related algorithm problems and solutions.

## Approaches

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Traverses the tree by going as deep as possible along a branch before backtracking.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Traverses the tree level by level, visiting all nodes at the current level before moving to the next.
3. **Binary Tree Manipulation**: Problems involving manipulation of binary tree structures.

## Problems

- **Invert Binary Tree**: Mirrors a binary tree by swapping each node's left and right children.

# Two Pointers Problems and Solutions

This directory contains algorithm problems that use the two pointers technique.

## Approach

The two pointers technique involves using two pointers to iterate through the data structure (often an array) in a single pass. This approach is useful for:

1. **Searching pairs in a sorted array**: Finding pairs that satisfy certain conditions
2. **Removing duplicates**: Identifying and handling duplicate elements efficiently
3. **Merging sorted arrays**: Combining two sorted arrays into a single sorted array
4. **Container with Most Water**: Finding the container that holds the most water

## Problems

- **Three Sum**: Find all triplets in the array which give the sum of zero
- **Most Water**: Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container that holds the most water
- **Two Sum (Sorted)**: Find two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a specific target

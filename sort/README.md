# Sorting Problems and Solutions

This directory contains algorithm problems that involve sorting techniques.

## Approaches

Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science with various algorithms:

1. **Comparison-Based Sorting**: Algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, and HeapSort
2. **Non-Comparison Sorting**: Algorithms like Counting Sort, Radix Sort, and Bucket Sort
3. **Custom Sorting**: Problems requiring custom comparison logic
4. **Partial Sorting**: Problems that don't require fully sorting the data

## Problems

- **Merge Sorted Array**: Merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array
- **Sort Colors**: Sort an array containing only three distinct values
- **Kth Largest Element**: Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array

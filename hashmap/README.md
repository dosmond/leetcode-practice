# HashMap Problems and Solutions

This directory contains algorithm problems that use hash maps (dictionaries) as the primary data structure.

## Approach

Hash maps provide O(1) average-case time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups, making them ideal for:

1. **Counting Elements**: Counting occurrences of elements in an array or string
2. **Finding Pairs**: Identifying pairs of elements that satisfy certain conditions
3. **Caching**: Storing computed results for quick lookup
4. **Frequency Analysis**: Analyzing the frequency of characters or elements

## Problems

- **Two Sum**: Find indices of two numbers that add up to a target value
- **Valid Anagram**: Determine if one string is an anagram of another
- **Group Anagrams**: Group strings that are anagrams of each other
- **Word Pattern**: Determine if a pattern matches a given string
- **Isomorphic Strings**: Determine if two strings are isomorphic
- **Ransom Note**: Determine if a ransom note can be constructed from a magazine

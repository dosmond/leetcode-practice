# Backtracking Problems and Solutions

This directory contains algorithm problems that use backtracking approaches.

## Approach

Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems by trying to build a solution incrementally, and abandoning a solution ("backtracking") as soon as it determines that the solution cannot be completed. It's useful for:

1. **Combinatorial Problems**: Finding all possible combinations or permutations
2. **Constraint Satisfaction Problems**: Finding solutions that satisfy a set of constraints
3. **Decision Problems**: Determining if a solution exists

## Problems

- **Phone Number Letter Combinations**: Find all possible letter combinations from a phone number
- **N-Queens**: Place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other
- **Permutations**: Generate all possible permutations of a given array
- **Subsets**: Generate all possible subsets of a given array
